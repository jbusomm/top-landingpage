## Main problems

The main problems I encountered where: 
- The image at the _'hero'_ section shrinking and not behaving how I intended.
- [X] Fixed!
- Not knowing how to go about the position of the header + _'hero'_, because when I moved the screen to other monitors it would break (smaller monitor than usual)
